# Learning About Linux

## Introduction
Linux is a free operating system and is common on servers. Being highly customizable, the operating system can be hugely customized for particular needs. This operating system can boast of its excellent security features and strong mechanisms of protection.

## Section 1: Linux History
Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991 when he decided he wanted to take advantage of the capabilities of his new PC, which contained an 80386 processor. Rather than writing to an existing operating system, he decided he wanted to talk directly to the hardware.

In that year of 1991, Torvalds was a student in Finland, majoring in computer science, when he decided to develop a free Unix-like kernel as his personal project. It was this way that the Linux kernel came to birth. Curiously enough, he published his work to the public, which results in a worldwide community of developers who started working on its development.

Unlike other kernels at the time, Torvalds' kernel was a monolithic kernel, meaning it allowed all OS services to operate within the same space for heightened efficiency. More importantly, it was also compatible with software developed for the GNU system.

Linus Torvalds serves as the lead maintainer of the Linux kernel. The stable branch is maintained by Greg Kroah-Hartman. ZoÃ« Kooyman, who is the executive director of the Free Software Foundation, represents the GNU components. The third-party non-GNU components are contributed by legions of volunteers and companies.

## Section 2: Linux Distributions

**Debian** : Debian is one of the oldest and most stable Linux distributions, being very strict in its sense of purity regarding free software. Many distributions are based upon it, such as Ubuntu. Thus, people have come to like it because of its dependability and its large pool of packages.

**openSUSE** : openSUSE is an all-purpose stable distribution that targets developers and system administrators. It features powerful tools such as YaST to configure the system, and issues both a rolling distribution called Tumbleweed and a stable version named Leap.

**Ubuntu** : Ubuntu is one of the most accessible distributions for new comers, as it has an easy-to-use interface with very good community support. Since it is based on Debian, it receives quite frequent updates and also has an LTS version available that delivers better stability.

**Mint** : Linux Mint is set up to be very, very easy to use for Windows migrants. It includes a similar desktop feel to Windows, and it comes with software pre-installed that you'll most likely need.

## Section 3: Basic Linux Commands
## Basic Commands
- `whoami` : show your username
- `ls`: lists files and directories in the current directory.
- `pwd` : show current directory
- `mkdir <dir_name>` : make directory dir
- `rm <file_name>` : delete the file or directory
- `cp` : copy a file and directories
- `mv` : Move/rename files and directories.
- `find` : Search for files and directories.
